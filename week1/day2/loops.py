# Loops 
# Loops are used to go through a speciifc amount of times 
# It can call something a bunch of times 

# num = 0
 #while 5 > num:
   # print ("*****")
   # num = num + 1


# Break statement will stop the loop from running indefinitely 

# "control c" cancels it 

# A while loop does something WHILE this is true 

# while(condition to evaluate): 

# Condition can be checked many times 


# Multiple ways to break out of a loop: 
# - break statement OR make the logic not make sense 

# For loop
