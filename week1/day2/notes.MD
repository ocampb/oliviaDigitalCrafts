# Intro to Python

SYNTAX - RULES OF THAT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE

# Fundamentals in most programming languages:

- LOOPS
- VARIABLES
- FUNCTIONS/METHODS
- CLASSES

Function:

1. Function Name
2. Function Arguments (sometimes)
3. Function Body

Syntax in python for a function:
#def
#functionName
():

def functionName():

When you learn a new langugae you have to learn the built in methods and built in functions. Every language has a built in function.

To run a function --
For Python, it's print()
For JS it's console.log

# Variables

- We store stuff in variables to use it later or use in a function
- When you make a variable, you make a box and put something in that box.

# Variable Types

- String >> anything in between quotation marks
- Boolean >> always true or false (in python, you always write true with a capital T)
- Integers >> anything equal to a whole number
- Float >> anything equal to a decimal number
- Lists/Arrays: anything inside of square brackets; can contain multiple types of data
  - access a list by using what is called the index of a list, different parts of that list
  - computers start counting at 0
  - Lists and loops go together like PB&J
- Dictionary/Object: key/value

A For list is probably how you want to reference a list
