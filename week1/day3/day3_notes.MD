list = []
Access things inside of a list using an index

Lists can easily fill up memory because they have to be stored together 

time and space complexity >> how much time will this take and how much space will it take 

we don't track the best case scenario, we track the worst case scenario and we prepare for the worst case scenario 

worst case sceanrio in terms of computer science - always think that when we 

Big O Notation - how much time will this take worst case and how much space will this take worst case 

"Cracking the Coding Interview" book - covers everything 

Read i O(1) = constant 
Create O(n) = 
n = whatever the size of your array is and your list is (worst case scenario, I need to find a place to put x number of things)
