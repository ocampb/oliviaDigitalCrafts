# Create a list of numbers, print their sum.

# pretzel = [1, 5, 6, 3, 8, 2, -1]
# sum = 0

# for unit in pretzel: 
#     sum = sum+unit
  
# print(sum)


# 2. Largest Number
# Create a list of numbers, print the largest of the numbers.

# biggest = 0

# for unit in pretzel:
#    if unit > biggest:
#     biggest = unit

# print (biggest)



# # #3. Smallest Number
# # # Create a list of numbers, print the smallest of the numbers.

# smallest = 0

# for unit in pretzel:
#    if unit < smallest:
#     smallest = unit

# print (smallest)

# # #4. Even Numbers
# # # Create a list of numbers, print each number in the list that is even.

# for item in pretzel:
#    if (item % 2) == 0:
#       print(item)


# #5. Positive Numbers
# #Create a list of numbers, print each number in the list that is greater than zero.

# for item in pretzel:
#     if (item > 0):
#         print(item)



# #6. Positive Numbers II
# #Create a list of numbers, create a new list which contains every number in the given list which is positive.

# list2 = []

# for item in pretzel:
#     if (item > 0):
#         list2.append(item)

# print (list2)

#7. Multiply a list
#Create a list of numbers, and a single factor (also a number), create a new list consisting of each of the numbers in the first list multiplied by the factor. Print this list.
## example

# newlist = [] 
# dog = [1, 2, 3]
# factor = 2

# for unit in dog: 
#      print(unit*factor)



# 8. Reverse a String

me = "Olivia"
