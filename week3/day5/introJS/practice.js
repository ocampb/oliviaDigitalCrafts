// 3 ways to make variables in JS 
// let, var or const

let rahmin = "gamer"
var carlos = "meme lord"
const jason = "windows user" 
// let and var can be reassigned
// const cannot be reassigned and cannot change value type (can't switch from string to integer). It can have stuff added to it, ex updating a list 

// Objects (Dictionaries)

const restaurants = ["Olive Garden", "Texas Roadhouse", "Chili's"];
console.log(restaurants[2]);

// for restaurant of restaurants

for (let restaurant of restaurants){
    console.log(restaurant)
}
